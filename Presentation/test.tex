  \frametitle{The Infamous Disappearing Text}

Here is a frame, it's a bit \alert<2-3>{boring}.

It's so boring, we'll see it \only<-3>{{\color<2-3>{gray}twice}}.

\only<3>{But the second time, we'll try to make it more interesting by making some of those words change colour.}

\only<5>{The third time, we'll wave a magic wand to make all the gray words disappear.}

\frametitle{Some Comments}
This frame is perhaps even more so.
