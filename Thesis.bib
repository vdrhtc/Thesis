abstract = {We propose a realizable architecture using one-dimensional transmission line resonators to reach the strong coupling limit of cavity quantum electrodynamics in superconducting electrical circuits. The vacuum Rabi frequency for the coupling of cavity photons to quantized excitations of an adjacent electrical circuit (qubit) can easily exceed the damping rates of both the cavity and the qubit. This architecture is attractive both as a macroscopic analog of atomic physics experiments and for quantum computing and control, since it provides strong inhibition of spontaneous emission, potentially leading to greatly enhanced qubit lifetimes, allows high-fidelity quantum non-demolition measurements of the state of multiple qubits, and has a natural mechanism for entanglement of qubits separated by centimeter distances. In addition it would allow production of microwave photon states of fundamental importance for quantum communication.},

Superconducting quantum devices can now perform sophisticated quantum engineering locally on chip and a detailed method to achieve coherent optical quantum interconnection between distant superconducting devices is a vital, but highly challenging, goal. We describe a concrete opto-magneto-mechanical system that can interconvert microwave-to-optical quantum information with high fidelity. In one such node we utilise the magnetic fields generated by the supercurrent of a flux qubit to coherently modulate a mechanical oscillator that is part of a high-Q optical cavity to achieve high fidelity microwave-to-optical quantum information exchange. We analyze the transfer between two spatially distant nodes connected by an optical fibre and using currently accessible parameters we predict that the fidelity of transfer could be as high as \~{}80\%, even with significant loss.},

physics. However, advances in quantum physics have stimulated interest
in its potential impact on such technology. This article is an
introductory review of three aspects of quantum information processing,
cryptography, computation, and teleportation. The author serves up hors
d'oeuvres on the relevant parts of quantum physics and the sorts of
quantum systems which might form the building blocks for quantum
processors. Quantum cryptography utilizes states of individual quantum
systems for the transfer of conventional classical bits of information.
The impossibility of measuring quantum systems without disturbing them
guarantees the detection of eavesdropping and hence secure information
transfer is possible. In a sense, teleportation is the inverse of
cryptography, using more robust classical bits to faithfully transfer a
quantum state through a noisy environment. Quantum computation utilizes
the evolving quantum state of a complex system, which consists of many
interacting individuals. If such a machine could be built, it would be
capable of solving some problems which are intractable on any
conventional computer; he illustrates this with Shor's (see Proc. 35th
IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, p.124, 1994) quantum
factoring algorithm. Details are given of the current experimental
achievements, proposals, and prospects for the future and of the patents

abstract = {Short dephasing times pose one of the main challenges in realizing a quantum computer. Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called "sweet spots." This latter approach led to significant improvement of \$T\_2\$ times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et al., Science 296, 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the "transmon." Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy \$E\_J/E\_C\$. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with \$E\_J/E\_C\$, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other known channels.},

We consider a specific case, corresponding to a very simple situation, where a primary system interacts with a bath of harmonic oscillators at zero temperature, with an interaction Hamiltonian that resembles the Jaynes-Cummings format. We start with the Born-Markov equation and, tracing out the bath degrees of freedom, we obtain an equation in the Lindblad form. The specific situation is very instructive, for it makes it easy to realize that the Lindblads represent the effect on the main system caused by the interaction with the bath, and that the Markov approximation is a fundamental condition for the emergence of the Lindbladian operator. The formal derivation of the Lindblad equation for a more general case requires the use of quantum dynamical semi-groups and broader considerations regarding the environment and temperature than we have considered in the particular case treated here.},

@article{Milburn2009,
abstract = {We review the physical principles behind measurement-based quantum information processing with optical fields. The original Knill–Laflamme–Milburn (KLM) scheme, based on single-photon states, is explained, as well as extensions of the scheme inspired by the idea of cluster state quantum computing, which dramatically reduce the resources required for implementation. A careful analysis of the intrinsic error sources in optical cluster state methods indicates that fault-tolerant quantum gates are feasible given developments in current technology. The main impediment to progress is the lack of single-photon sources and we briefly review what kinds of sources are needed. We conclude with a discussion of phase-shift coherent state codes and discuss a possible implementation in circuit quantum electrodynamics.},

abstract ={If the bits of computers are someday scaled down to the size of individual atoms, quantum mechanical effects may profoundly change the nature of computation itself. The wave function of such a quantum computer could consist of a superposition of many computations carried out simultaneously; this kind of parallelism could be exploited to make some important computational problems, like the prime factoring of large integers, tractable. However, building such a quantum computer would place undreamed of demands on the experimental realization of highly quantum-coherent systems; present-day experimental capabilities in atomic physics and other fields permit only the most rudimentary implementation of quantum computation.},

abstract = {Quantum computers promise to exceed the computational efficiency of ordinary classical machines because quantum algorithms allow the execution of certain tasks in fewer steps. But practical implementation of these machines poses a formidable challenge. Here I present a scheme for implementing a quantum-mechanical computer. Information is encoded onto the nuclear spins of donor atoms in doped silicon electronic devices. Logical operations on individual spins are performed using externally applied electric fields, and spin measurements are made using currents of spin-polarized electrons. The realization of such a computer is dependent on future refinements of conventional silicon electronics.},

abstract = {Superconducting qubits are solid state electrical circuits fabricated using techniques borrowed from conventional integrated circuits. They are based on the Josephson tunnel junction, the only non-dissipative, strongly non-linear circuit element available at low temperature. In contrast to microscopic entities such as spins or atoms, they tend to be well coupled to other circuits, which make them appealling from the point of view of readout and gate implementation. Very recently, new designs of superconducting qubits based on multi-junction circuits have solved the problem of isolation from unwanted extrinsic electromagnetic perturbations. We discuss in this review how qubit decoherence is affected by the intrinsic noise of the junction and what can be done to improve it.},

@article{Macha2014,
abstract = {The key issue for the implementation of a metamaterial is to demonstrate the existence of collective modes corresponding to coherent oscillations of the meta-atoms. Atoms of natural materials interact with electromagnetic fields as quantum two-level systems. Artificial quantum two-level systems can be made, for example, using superconducting nonlinear resonators cooled down to their ground state. Here we perform an experiment in which 20 of these quantum meta-atoms, so-called flux qubits, are embedded into a microwave resonator. We observe the dispersive shift of the resonator frequency imposed by the qubit metamaterial and the collective resonant coupling of eight qubits. The realized prototype represents a mesoscopic limit of naturally occurring spin ensembles and as such we demonstrate the AC-Zeeman shift of a resonant qubit ensemble. The studied system constitutes the implementation of a basic quantum metamaterial in the sense that many artificial atoms are coupled collectively to the quantized mode of a photon field.},
